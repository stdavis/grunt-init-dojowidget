==========================

[*NOTE*: This project has been superseded by the [generator-dojo-widget](https://github.com/stdavis/generator-dojo-widget) yeoman generator.]

A [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding) template for creating a new dojo widget and associated [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) test suite.

To install:

```
git clone https://github.com/stdavis/grunt-init-dojowidget.git ~/.grunt-init/dojowidget
```

To use:

```
grunt-init dojowidget
```

Note: All files are created in the `src/` directory. Works well with the [dojo-boilerplate](https://github.com/csnover/dojo-boilerplate) folder structure.
